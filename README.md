  #Note: this is the old version. Please look forward the amazing [python 3.6+ version](https://github.com/Patent2net/P2N-v3)
  No binary version, full python. Less buggy, fastest and many new features.

About
-----
[Patent2Net] (http://patent2netv2.vlab4u.info/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=page) is :
* elaborated and maintained (on a free base) by a [small international team] (http://patent2netv2.vlab4u.info/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=about_p2n:community;) of university professors and researchers.  
* an "open source" package and contributions are welcome
* available "[as it is] (http://patent2netv2.vlab4u.info/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=about_p2n:disclaimer)".

Patent2Net is a free package, dedicated to :
* augment the use of patent information in academic, nano and small firms, developing countries (all those without pay mode access)
* learn, study and practice how to collect, treat and communicate "textual bibliographic information", and automation process
* provide statistical analysis and representations of a set of patents.

The [results](http://patent2netv2.vlab4u.info/) of statistical patents analysis can be explored as a website with the firefox browser
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A [binary version] (http://patent2netv2.vlab4u.info/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=user_manual:download_install;) is available
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Train how to search patent information using interface] (http://patent2netv2.vlab4u.info/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=user_manual:patent_search;)
------------------------------------------------------
Install Patent2Net python scripts on Windows
--------------------------------------------
To run as python script, see the file install-dev.txt
Install Patent2Net on Linux (Fix needed).
---------------------------
See requirements.txt and InstallP2NLinux.txt
If you're using Ubuntu or Debian distributions, make sure to have PIP installed:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip build-essential python-dev libjpeg-dev libxml2-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev

Then, run the requirements.txt file to install all dependencies:

    sudo pip install -r Development/requirements.txt

To use the current Development version, you can make a symbolic link to your desired folder:

    ln -sd Development Patent2Net

Use Patent2Net (script mode)
----------------------------
Follow the "Register the use of P2N:" [described here] (http://patent2netv2.vlab4u.info/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=user_manual:download_install;) to install your acreditation in the “cles-epo.txt” file in root directory.

Copy any of the *.cql file from /RequestsSets directory as requete.cql in root directory, and/or adapt the requete.cql to your need.

Use the /Patent2Net/ProcessPy.bat or the /Patent2Net/Process.sh and enjoy!

Todo List (not limitative, just ideas):
---------------------------------------
#### Although Patent2Net is fully operational, works fine and is enough to begin using Patent Information, a lot can be done to improve analysis:
* Correct the issues (continuous process, of course)
* Add some more information in the result html page (ModeleContenuIndex.html). Great to add the treating date (thus can be different from gathering) and P2N version
* As information analysis do not allways represent the whole Patent Universe (i.e. french abstrat) provide the proportion of P.U. concerned by each analysis
* Treat Designated State(s) information for EP and WO patentes to complete the attractivity maps
* Improve the Mindmap option to get it more efficient for creativity (Celso is working on)
* Build the entire network as a gephi file for download to let new combined network analysis possible
* Use the list of standardised applicant names from EPO to normalize nets and tables. See: [CSV datafile] (http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/rawdata.nsf/0/71DE2EB24A084A19C1257F3B0032BA98/)
Or may be this name standardization routines: https://sites.google.com/site/patentdataproject/Home/posts/namestandardizationroutinesuploaded


#### Add some new capabilities to Patent2Net, i.e.:
* Within the Patent Universe, build a drawings gallery with hyperlink to the Espacenet patent (Andre is working on)
* Within the Familly Patent Universe, provide all the same analysis as with the Patent Universe (Roberto is working on)
* Include the treatment of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) with the proportion of P.U. concerned (http://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive.html)
* Build a small database to display results of a specific (Familly) Patent Universe. Database could be [PouchDB] (https://pouchdb.com/) or equivalent

#### Provide some new ways of gathering and analysis of patent information, i.e.:
* Within the Familly Patent Universe, provide a new range of analysis, considering a familly as a unique entity (invention)
* Limit the Familly Patent Universe to the only Priority patents, and provide a complete analysis
* Using citations of the Familly Patent Universe, provide genealogic analysis, especially descendants to try to detect invention fronts.
* Gather research reports when avalaible and provide analysis chains

#### New contributions and ideas are welcome
